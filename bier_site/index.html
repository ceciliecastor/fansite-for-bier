                    The process of making honey starts with foraging worker honey bees – and flowers, of course. Neither
                    the male honey bees, (the drones) nor the queen honey bee forage for the colony. As the weather
                    begins to warm up, the bees will begin foraging on flowers. Bees have to work very hard to make
                    honey, with endless trips to flowers to collect nectar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To produce a pound of honey, foraging honey bees have to fly a whopping 55,000 miles. And that’s
                    a lot of honey bees, working very hard, because each honey bee will only produce around one twelfth
                    of a teaspoon of honey in its life! Oh, and that’s despite the fact that a foraging honey bee visits
                    up to 100 flowers – per foraging trip. No wonder it takes about 556 foraging bees to visit 2 million
                    flowers, just to make a pound of honey.

                        Honey bees collect pollen by packing it onto their back legs. They comb it out of theirhair, mix
                        it with nectar and press it into a special bowl-like structure on the leg called a corbicula.
                        Long, wiry hairs hold the pollen in place for their flight home. Back at the hive,
                        the pollen is stored in cells so that it can be eaten later. Pollen is very nutritious and is
                        especially important in the diet of young nurse bees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bees require a variety in their diet because not all flower pollen has the same nutritional
                        value. For that reason, it’s important to support the floral diversity in your city. An ideal
                        pollinator garden should have 20 different flower types that bloom throughout the year.

                        Honey bees are fascinating creatures. They collaborate in a way that is hard for us to
                        comprehend, especially when we are initially learning beekeeping. The way they work together is
                        so complete, in fact, that it really helps to think of a honey bee colony as a single organism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each individual bee plays a role, it is true. But that role is so small and that life so short
                        that it can never really see the benefit of all it's hard work. That’s something only the colony
                        can realize. Life inside the hive is relatively comfortable to the harsh and dangerous
                        environment
                        beyond its boundaries. The bees don’t leave other than when necessary. But there are a number of
                        reasons why they do need to do just that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The queen, as we’ve already discussed, will take a few flights at the very beginning of her life
                        to orient and mate and then again if it’s time to swarm. The drones, too, go out frequently on
                        mating flights. Beyond those, there are two main reasons worker bees may leave the hive -
                        foraging and
                        absconding.

                    MONEY FOR MY HONEY

                <div class="colum">
                    <p>The bee is a marvelous flying machine. She can carry a payload of nectar or pollen close to her
                        own weight. Consider that even the most advanced design in aircraft can only take off with a
                        load one-quarter of its own weight and you’ll appreciate the miracle that the honeybee can
                        remain airborne with such a load.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When her nectar “sacs” are full, the honeybee returns to the
                        hive. Nectar is delivered to one of the indoor bees and is then passed mouth-to-mouth from bee
                        to bee until its moisture content is reduced from about 70% to 20%. This changes the nectar
                        intohoney. Sometimes the nectar is stored at once in cells in the honeycomb before the
                        mouth-to-mouth working because some evaporation is caused by the 32.5°C temperature inside the
                        hive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the honey is placed in storage cells and capped with beeswax in readiness for the
                        arrival of newborn baby bees. Pollen is mixed with nectar to make “bee bread” and is fed to the
                        larvae. A baby bee needs food rich in protein if the bee community is to flourish.
